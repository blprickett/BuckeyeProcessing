# Preprocessing Script for Buckeye Data
This script assumes:
* The unzipped Buckeye data has been saved in a directory called "Data" that's in the same directory as where you're running the script from
* You have three empty directories in the script's directory, named: Train, Dev, and Test.
* You haven't made any changes to the internal directory structure of the Buckeye data. So everything is still organized by speaker and each speaker's data is separated across several, uniquely numbered files.
